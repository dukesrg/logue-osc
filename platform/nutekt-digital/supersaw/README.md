# Supersaw

This is a supersaw oscillator

## Parameters
* Unison level (shape / A knob)
* Detune level (shift shape / B knob)
* Unison (param 1) - maximum unison 1...12 pairs (shape sensitivity)
* Detune (param 2) - maximum detune 1...100 cents (shift shape sensitivity)
* Attenuate (param 3) - result wave attenuation 0...30dB
* Polyphony (param 4) - maximum note polyphony 1...8 (only for NTS-1 with firmware 1.2.0 and above and legato mode off)

## Konwn issues
* Sound degradation when using high level of unison and simultaneous polyphony notes together and/or in combination with other FX due to limited CPU processing power
